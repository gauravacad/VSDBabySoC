# Step by step modeling walkthrough
## Cloning , Setup and  Directory structure
- Clone or set up the directory structure as follows:
 
### STEP 1. To begin, clone the VSDBabySoC repository using the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git
$ cd ~/vcdflow/VSDBabySoC/
$ ls VSDBabySoC/
images  LICENSE  Makefile  README.md  src
```
### STEP2: TLV to Verilog Conversion for RVMYTH
Initially, you will see only the rvmyth.tlv file inside src/module/, since the RVMYTH core is written in TL-Verilog.
To convert it into a .v file for simulation, follow the steps below:
🔧 TLV to Verilog Conversion Steps

```
# Step A: Install python3-venv (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
cd VSDBabySoC/

# Step B: Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_venv/bin/activate

# Step C: Install SandPiper-SaaS inside the virtual environment
pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas

# Step D: Convert rvmyth.tlv to Verilog
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```
The above conversion will be reflected in the output director in `/src/module` it uses the tool Sandpiper for conversion.
- SandPiper is a code generator that generates readable, well-structured, Verilog or SystemVerilog code from the given TL-Verilog code.
- SandPiper SaaS Edition runs as a microservice in the cloud to support easy open-source development. Install Sanpiper SaaS Edition for this project.
- To run locally, SandPiper Education Edition can be requested from RedwoodEDA.

# Pre-Synthesis Simulation:

Before synthesis, the RTL design was verified using a testbench (testbench.v) that instantiates the vsdbabysoc module and applies a series of stimulus to validate its functionality. The simulation was run using Icarus Verilog, and the waveform was inspected in GTKWave to ensure correct operation. the following command is executed while the paths to the current directory and the files required must be at available for proper execution without failure.

``` bash
$ cd ~/vsdflow/VSDBabySoC/
$ mkdir -p output/pre_synth_sim
$ pwd -> `/vsd/VSDBabySoC/`
$ iverilog -o ./output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM -I ./src/include -I ./src/module ./src/module/testbench.v 
```  
- DPRE_SYNTH_SIM defines the macro PRE_SYNTH_SIM for conditional compilation., which can be used inside Verilog files like: 
- -I<directory>: Adds an include directory for Verilog source files that use \include "file.v"` directives.
- if we wont include the -I then it will lands to error for .Vh files and other verilog files which are called by top vsdbabysoc module.

- Now after including all the files we have output in the given `/pre_synth_sim` folder

<img width="829" height="252" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5255cf15-9bd1-4f50-8bf3-da26cbdc4c47" />

### Running the next step to generate the VCD file

<img width="824" height="237" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d821b28a-1504-483a-b8db-6c076b5c258d" />

### Invoking the GTKwave to see the RTL simulation Also making the output view for analog type data.

<img width="908" height="825" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e044de4-8953-4e98-aae6-d95f586d4ed9" />


<img width="1149" height="502" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/287b4432-0c1a-47a9-88a7-c0ae6ad73504" />

### In this picture we can see the following signals:

- CLK: This is the input CLK signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.
- reset: This is the input reset signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.
- OUT: This is the output OUT signal of the VSDBabySoC module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.
- RV_TO_DAC[9:0]: This is the 10-bit output [9:0] OUT port of the RVMYTH core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.
- OUT: This is a real datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the output wire real OUT signal of the DAC module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally.
- This can be viewed by changing the Data Format of the signal to Analog → Step
- This is your reference RTL behavior.

# Post-synthesis simulation
The design is synthesised by the yosys and we see the post synthesis simulation to ensure that it matches with the pre synthesis RTL Simulation.
we use yosys for Synthesizing our design. 
- Synthesising the Design with the below script step by step. here
- Inputs:
- RTL Verilog files (vsdbabysoc.v, rvmyth.v, clk_gate.v)
- Analog IPs (avsddac.v, avsdpll.v)
- Technology timing libraries (.lib files- avsdpll.lib etc)
- Tool: Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite
- Output: A gate-level netlist (vsdbabysoc_netlist.v)

<img width="559" height="365" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af93a143-f0ce-4723-8164-8dfb0b8fb455" />

``` bash
read_verilog src/module/vsdbabysoc.v
read_verilog -I src/include src/module/rvmyth.v
read_verilog -I src/include src/module/clk_gate.v
read_liberty -lib src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_liberty -lib src/lib/avsddac.lib
read_liberty -lib src/lib/avsdpll.lib

synth -top vsdbabysoc
write_verilog -noattr reports/vsdbabysoc_netlist.v
show vsdbabysoc

dfflibmap -liberty src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
- The output is generated in the post_synthesis folder but for running the GLS for netlist file we need to copy the same in the `./src/module` folder. 
- also we nned to copy our verilog_modules files. 
- copy the generated yosys output netlist file vsdbabysoc.synth.v to ./src/module/

```
$ vsdflow/
iverilog -o output/post_synthesis/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM  -I ./src/include/ -I ./src/module/ ./src/module/testbench.v
# this will generate the `post_synth_sim.out` as stated in above command.
```

- Finally we are getting Post syntheis output thatis GLS.

<img width="1006" height="467" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5736b5af-994d-4c54-9992-57c598f957c1" />

In this picture we can see the following signals:

**CLK**: This is the input CLK signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.
**reset**: This is the input reset signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.
**OUT**: This is the output OUT signal of the VSDBabySoC module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.
*OUT[9:0]**: This is the 10-bit output [9:0] OUT port of the RVMYTH core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.
- This is a real datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the output wire real OUT signal of the DAC module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally.

## Debugging the error 

- The `rvmyth` core uses `include` directives to import Verilog header files (`.vh`). Yosys was not aware of the `src/include/` directory where these files are located.
- Add the `-I src/include` flag to required read_verilog commands in the Yosys script. This tells Yosys to add that directory to its search path for header files.
- In $YOUR_PDK_PATH/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_sc_hd/verilog/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v file we should manually correct endif SKY130_FD_SC_HD__LPFLOW_BLEEDER_FUNCTIONAL_V to endif //SKY130_FD_SC_HD__LPFLOW_BLEEDER_FUNCTIONAL_V.
- We can simulate with the functional models by passing the FUNCTIONAL define to iverilog. Also we need to set UNIT_DELAY macro to some value. As a result we'll have iverilog -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 <THE SOURCE-CODEs   TO BE COMPILED.





## Conclusion
This process successfully transformed the vsdbabysoc RTL design into a verified, synthesizable gate-level netlist. The debugging journey highlighted the importance of correctly handling IP integration, from Verilog header paths to precise port-matching in hierarchical designs. The identical pre- and post-synthesis simulation results provide high confidence in the netlist to move in the stage.
