# VSDBabySoC Simulation and Syntheis 
## Week 3 LAB Task â€“ VSDBabySoC

### 1. Basic RTL Simulation
- **Goal**: Verify functionality of the SoC design before synthesis.
- **outcome**: Functional RTL waveform in GTKWave.
- **Tools**: iverilog and gtkwave
- **Steps**: Compile the RTL + Testbench:

### 2. Synthesis with Yosys
- **Goal**: Convert RTL into a gate-level netlist using sky130_fd_sc_hd library.
- **outcome**: Synthesized gate-level netlist (vsdbabysoc_netlist.v).
- **Tools**: Yosys, Sky130 PDK standard cell library.
- **Steps**: Compile the NETLIST + Testbench:

### 3. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)
- **Goal**: Verify functionality of synthesized netlist against RTL.
- **outcome**:GLS waveform (dump.vcd).
- **Tools**: iverilog and gtkwave
- **Steps**: Compile with netlist, testbench, primitives, and standard cell models

### 4. Analysis â€“ RTL vs GLS Waveforms
- **Goal**: Compare timing behavior and ensure functional equivalence.
**Checks:**
- Functional outputs should match.
- GLS waveforms may show additional gate delays not present in RTL.
- Setup/hold issues or mismatches must be investigated.
- **Deliverable**: Documented comparison of RTL vs GLS timing in GTKWave screenshots.

### 5. Documentation (Week 3 Report) Include:
- Overview of SoC modules (RISC-V core, PLL, DAC, top module).
- RTL simulation steps & screenshots.
- Synthesis flow and netlist generation.
- GLS steps & waveforms.
- Side-by-side analysis of RTL vs GLS.
- Observations and conclusion.

## What is RVMYTH?
RVMYTH is a simple **RISC-V based CPU**, introduced in a workshop by **RedwoodEDA** and **VSD**.  
- Developed during a 5-day workshop, where even middle-school students participated in building a processor from scratch.  
- Uses **TL-Verilog (TLV)** for faster development.  
- Contributions to the IP are open-source and made by students.  

## What is PLL?
A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is a control system that generates an output signal whose **phase is related to the phase of an input signal**.  
- Widely used for synchronization.  
- Essential for **clock generation** and **distribution** in SoCs.  

## What is DAC?
A **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** converts a **digital signal into an analog signal**.  
- Enables generation of digitally-defined transmission signals.  
- High-speed DACs are critical in **mobile communications**.  
- Ultra-high-speed DACs are used in **optical communication systems**.  

# VSDBabySoC Modeling
Please note that in the following sections we will mention some repos that we used to model the SoC. However the main source code is resided in [Source-Code Directory](src) and these modules are in [Modules Sub-Directory](src/module).

## LAB WORK VSDBABYSoC
1. Pre-requisites:
``` bash
$ cd VSDBabySoC/
$ python -m venv my-venv
$ python3 -m venv my-venv
$ my-venv/bin/pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
$ make pre_synth_sim
$ source my-venv/bin/activate
$ make pre_synth_sim
```


## RVMYTH modeling

As we mentioned in [What is RVMYTH](#what-is-rvmyth) section, RVMYTH is designed and created by the TL-Verilog language. So we need a way for compile and trasform it to the Verilog language and use the result in our SoC. Here the `sandpiper-saas` could help us do the job.

1. [Here](https://github.com/shivanishah269/risc-v-core) is the repo we used as a reference to model the RVMYTH
2. [Here](https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsddac_interface?tab=readme-ov-file) is similar Repo which can also be looked upon for the same.

## PLL and DAC modeling

It is not possible to sythesis an analog design with Verilog, yet. But there is a chance to simulate it using `real` datatype. We will use the following repositories to model the PLL and DAC cores:

  1. [Here](https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsdpll_interface) is the repo we used as a reference to model the PLL
  2. [Here](https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsddac_interface) is the repo we used as a reference to model the DAC

**CAUTION:** In the beginning of the project, we get our verilog model of the PLL from [here](https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsdpll_interface). However, by proceeding the project to the physical design flow we realize that this model needs a little changes to become sufficient for a real IP core. So we changed it a little and created a new model named `AVSDPLL` based on [this](https://github.com/lakshmi-sathi/avsdpll_1v8) IP.


# Step by step modeling walkthrough
## Cloning , Setup and  Directory structure
- Clone or set up the directory structure as follows:
 
### STEP 1. To begin, clone the VSDBabySoC repository using the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git
$ cd ~/vcd/VSDBabySoC/
$ ls VSDBabySoC/
images  LICENSE  Makefile  README.md  src
```
### STEP2: TLV to Verilog Conversion for RVMYTH
Initially, you will see only the rvmyth.tlv file inside src/module/, since the RVMYTH core is written in TL-Verilog.
To convert it into a .v file for simulation, follow the steps below:
ðŸ”§ TLV to Verilog Conversion Steps

```
# Step A: Install python3-venv (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
cd VSDBabySoC/

# Step B: Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv dv_env
source sp_env/bin/activate

# Step C: Install SandPiper-SaaS inside the virtual environment
pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas

# Step D: Convert rvmyth.tlv to Verilog
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```

``` bash

read_liberty -lib src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_liberty -lib src/lib/avsddac.lib
read_liberty -lib src/lib/avsdpll.lib
read_verilog src/module/vsdbabysoc.v
read_verilog -I src/include src/module/rvmyth.v
read_verilog -I src/include src/module/clk_gate.v
read_verilog src/module/avsddac_stub.v
read_verilog src/module/avsdpll_stub.v
synth -top vsdbabysoc
dfflibmap -liberty src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
opt clean -purge
abc -liberty src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
flatten

write_verilog -noattr reports/vsdbabysoc_netlist.v
show vsdbabysoc
```

## Debugging the error 
### Error 1: Missing Include File

- Root Cause: The `rvmyth` core uses `include` directives to import Verilog header files (`.vh`). Yosys was not aware of the `src/include/` directory where these files are located.
- Resolution: Add the `-I src/include` flag to required read_verilog commands in the Yosys script. This tells Yosys to add that directory to its search path for header files.
