1. # VSDBabySoC
VSDBabySoC is a small yet powerful RISCV-based System-on-Chip (SoC).

- **The Key Components**: Includes a **current source**, **a PLL (avsdpll\_1v8)**, an embedded **RISC-V core (rvmyth)**, an **ADC/DAC (avsddac\_3v3)**, and an **SPI interface**.
- **Voltage Domains**: The SoC operates with distinct voltage domains: a 1.8V domain and a 3.3V domain, clearly indicating power supply requirements for different components.
- **Interconnections**: Arrows and labels illustrate the flow of signals and power between these blocks, such as clock signals (CLK) and data paths (B[3:0], D[9:0]).
- **The VSDBabySoC's:** primary purpose is to integrate and evaluate multiple open-source IPs cores and to calibrate its analog section.
  
## 2. Purpose of Digital to Analog converted (DAC)
- In real world, most of the data available is in the analog form in nature.
- Thereby we have two types of converters `analog` to digital` converter (ADC) and `digital to analog` converter (DAC).
- These two converting interfaces are essential to obtain the required operations of a processor (here RVMYTH) to manipulate the data of any electronic equipment.

### 2.1. Implementation of 10Bit Potentiometric DAC
- There are two commonly used `DAC conversions` (1) `Weighed resistors method` and (2) `R-2R ladder network method`. 
- The Principle here is to divide the iput voltage into N different output voltage values in the range of VREFH and VREFL for a N-Bit DAC.
- The design avsdac_3v3 DAC here achieve this by a simple resistors in series.
- The Chip Layout for the avsdac_3v3. It has 10 Bit dataline. with dimension 195.58 um x 117.45 um.
- avsdac_3v3 operating Modes with Fclk = 1 MHz.

## RISCV: RVMYTH CORE
- A RISC-V ISA is defined as a base integer ISA, which must be present in any implementation, plus optional extensions to the base ISA. Each base integer instruction set is characterized by
   - Width of the integer registers (XLEN)
   - Corresponding size of the address space
   - Number of integer registers (32 in RISC-V)
   - 


Here **RISC-V core (rvmyth)** is an open architecture enables us to create processors highly tailored for specific computational challenges.
